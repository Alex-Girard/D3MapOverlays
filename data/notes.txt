* districts-sf.json

The original data of neighborhood was found on:
https://data.sfgov.org/Geography/Neighborhoods/ejmn-jyk6?

Because the projection used by https://data.sfgov.org was not using long/lat coordinates, I had to re project them to get values that D3 could understand:

ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON data/neighborhood.json data/planning_neighborhoods.shp  -t_srs "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0"

Then:

topojson -p -o data/neighborhood-topo.json data/neighborhood.json

* food_inspection.csv

The original data of restaurant scores was found on:
https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Health/Restaurant-Scores/stya-26eb

The python script file extract_data.py was used to format the csv file and combine the LIVES score (see standard description at http://www.yelp.com/)healthscores) with the number of violations depending on their risk level
